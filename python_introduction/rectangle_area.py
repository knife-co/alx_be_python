# Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
# Define two variables in this file:
# length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
# width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
# For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
# Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
# Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].

length = 10
width = 5

area = length * width
